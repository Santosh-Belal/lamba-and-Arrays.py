lambda in python

A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.


Arrays in python

What is an Array?

An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

car1 = "Ford"

car2 = "Volvo"

car3 = "BMW"
